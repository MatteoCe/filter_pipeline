# Scripts and pipelines from Cecchetto et al. 2021 - Plankton metabarcoding using desalination plant filters


Here are deposited the scripts and pipelines described in Cecchetto et al. 2021 "A metabarcoding protocol to analyze coastal planktic communities collected by desalination plant filters: from sampling to basic exploratory analyses." 

## Summary/Abstract

The temporal dynamics of coastal planktic communities can be disclosed through DNA metabarcoding on the filters of reverse-osmosis desalination plants. Here we describe the steps that are necessary to process the filters in order to create the subsamples used for DNA extraction and the bioinformatic pipeline to perform the first exploratory analyses on this kind of dataset.

## Repository Structure

The repository is subdivided in two directories that reflect the subheadings of the publication and store different pipelines.
